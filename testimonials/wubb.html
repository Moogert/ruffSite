It's a little difficult to know where to start with Mrs. Ruff. She's been a tremendous positive influence over the years for both Hannah and myself (Jeffrey). From teaching my first composition class to writing my recommendation letter for Duke, Mrs. Ruff has been an excellent teacher and supporting figure, but has also been a family friend and academic mentor. I had the undesirable experience in high school of dealing with not one but two concussions, events which Mrs. Ruff was very flexible with. I have taken Spanish, Composition, English, and Literature with Mrs. Ruff, and honestly have no complaints about any of the courses. I can say with certainty that Mrs. Ruff is a fair grader, which means that she will give you a low grade if you hand in a shoddy product. (Of course, if you put the effort in, you can be pretty confident on a high grade. :) Mrs. Ruff meets students where they are at, but also won’t let more talented students get away with handing in material they didn’t work for. 

All things considered, my family and I would recommend Mrs. Ruff wholeheartedly. We really don't know how to thank her for all the things that she’s done for us, and we look forward to working with her in the future."
